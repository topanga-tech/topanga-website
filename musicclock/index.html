    							<ul>
                                    <li><h6 class="bold">Keep the app running in the background.</h6>For the best alarm experience, keep MusicClock for Spotify running in the background. While the app can trigger alarms when terminated, background mode provides more reliable audio playback and fragment looping.</li>
                                    <li><h6 class="bold">Device volume should not be set to 0.</h6>Make sure your device volume is audible. The physical ringer switch can be in any position - the app works in both ringer and silent modes when running.</li>
                                    <li><h6 class="bold">Silent mode considerations.</h6>If your device is in silent mode AND the system kills the app, alarms will only play through notification sounds. For guaranteed music playback, either keep the ringer on or ensure the app stays running.</li>
                                    <li><h6 class="bold">No Spotify account required.</h6> The app works without needing to sign up for or log into Spotify!</li>
                                    <li><h6 class="bold">Do Not Disturb considerations.</h6>When the app is running, alarms will play audio even with Do Not Disturb enabled. However we strongly suggest you to give a Do Not Disturb bypass/whitelist for the MusicClock app in your settings so that the alarm will go off even if the system kills the app. In the Settings app, go to Focus > Do Not Disturb > Apps > Allow Notifications From > MusicClock.</li>
                                    <li><h6 class="bold">Notifications for MusicClock for Spotify should be enabled in Settings. </h6>You are prompted to do this the first time you enable an alarm.</li>

                                                <li>Swipe the notification left and select "View", or </li>
                                                <li>Apply <a href="https://www.imore.com/3d-touch">3-D Touch</a> on the notification by pressing firmly on it.</li>

                                        </li>
                                        <li>Select either "Stop" or "Snooze"</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    You must select one of these options. If you simply ignore the alarm, or clear it away temporarily, it will go off again; it interprets that as a snooze! If this seems like a hassle, well, that's the point of an alarm.
                                    </li>

                                                <li>The app uses Spotify's preview system for alarm fragments. The USA has a fair share of free audio preview clips, yet some parts of the world do not. If you are unsatisfied with the selection in your country, email me and I will send you a refund for the inconvenience.</li>

                                                <li>Playlists are collections of songs. In this app, setting a Playlist as your alarm means that a random song from the Playlist will wake you up every morning.</li>

                                                <li>Until Spotify approves an official partnership with me, it is illegal for me to directly stream any copyrighted music from the Spotify app. I would get sued. This is why I can only provide 30 second preview clips, and it is also why you have to create playlists within the app. While this may sound awful, the app continues to improve in great strides. The first version of the app, in January 2019, wouldn’t let you lock your screen or even leave the app at night! The second version didn’t have ANY playlist support, and had tons of bugs. The app is continuing to improve every day and it will eventually offer all of Spotify’s content through the app. Email me for any updates on this progess!</li>
